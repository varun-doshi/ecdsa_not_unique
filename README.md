[Chapter 2](./ch2_not_unique/) - ECDSA signatures are not unique.

## Steps to run

This assumes familiarity with Javascript, Solidity and Foundry.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install `yarn` if you haven't. Run `yarn` to install npm packages. The installed packages will be used to generate keys and sign messages.
3. [Install foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) if you haven't. Run `forge install`.
4. For chapter 1, run `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=ch1 forge test`, and so on.
